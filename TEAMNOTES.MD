# Team notes
This is for maintaining communication about your team's working meetings to "ship" the project.

### October 5th Class Activity

#### What are the characteristics of the card?

The icon, Color Banner, Header and sub header, content body.

#### What design considerations must we take into account?

The size, heading overflow, mobile show all content, color, applications, accesibility of the card. 

#### What accessibility concerns do we potentially have?

Contrast, tab to body content, heading order, different languages

#### What security concerns do we potentially have?

Flexibility of content - who can edit content, loading SVGs

#### What "states" does this card have?

Hover, disabled, click to show, type of card

#### What do we call it?

project-two

#### What areas do we need to account for flexible content / HTML entry of any kind?

Textboxes, actions, gap between cards and other text (margin)

#### Do we have room for additional reusable atoms to be produced? (there are 4 total by my count)

emphasized icon

banner/header

scaffolding of card

whole card 


#### What should we call each of them?

Ex. from class (ODL is a company) - name depending on what we want to name it.

ODL-icon

ODL-science-card

ODL-header

ODL-card

#### Class Participation 10/14 - 
1. Simple colors is a very useful way to simply set and modify colors. We are going to implement it in our code.
2. We learned what the other team was creating, and how they modified the headers and subheaders on theirs. It helped us out because we were wondering how to do that.
3. Our next steps are to implement simple colors into our card. After that, we are continuing to work on our code for the card. 

# Meeting notes
These are notes to be maintained PER date that you meet. What you did and what the next steps are
### Meeting Date

1. Thursday Oct. 14th

#### What we did:

1. We focised on getting our simple colors implemented.  We looked over how to implement simple colors into our porjects during class today.  Simple colors is a required piece of this projectg so we wanted to get this in place early on.  Since we went over it today and we have a check in on Sunday, we want to get this done now.  We went through and followed the lecture/notes from class and things that were posted as a resource.  We successfully got simple colors implemented and pushed that code to the gitHub.  Right now it just has some filler words in it and a random color to the header.  This will be changed to actually reflect what the card is supposed to look like, we just wanted to make sure the header look correct per implementing simple colors.  

#### What we'll do next

1. Next we are trying to work on our icon. We are hoping to get that done before class on Tuesday so we have some code to review.  It will also help to review some code from our fellow classmates. 


# Status check ins
These are dedicated status check-ins as this is a multi-week project
### Check-in 1
Names-

-Icon = pad-icon

-Banner/Header = pad-header

-Scaffolding of card = pad-scaff

-whole card = pad-card


Properties-

-States 
-Size 
-Margins
-Colors

Design Considerations-

-Contrast 
-Accessibility
-Scalibility


In class on tuesday we will be dividing work on our elements evenly based on who is comfortable working on each part. We will also be helping each other if we run into any issues.

### Check-in 2
- This week we were able to successfully get simple colors implemented.  We got to go over how to do it during class on Thursday then we got that completely implemented after class.  I have this information in the meeting notes above, but for now we just have some filler words in the header where simple colors is implemented and a random color put in to make sure that simple colors was working correctly.  The wording will obviously be changed as well as the color in the header to match the card we are creating.  Simple colors is an awesome tool that saves a ton of time, we enjoyed the lecture on it during class on Thursday.  We are still working on our icon as well.  Hopefully we will get to meet tomorrow and get that finished up and then in class on Tuesday we will get to see and review our peers code on icons as we have planned.
