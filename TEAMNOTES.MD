# Team notes
This is for maintaining communication about your team's working meetings to "ship" the project.

### Tuesday Class Activity

#### What are the characteristics of the card?

The card can contain URL and icons.

#### What design considerations must we take into account?

The size, color, applications, accesibility of the card. 

#### What accessibility concerns do we potentially have?

Not being able to tab to different elements of the card, we should always include this process. 

#### What security concerns do we potentially have?



#### What "states" does this card have?



#### What do we call it?

#### What areas do we need to account for flexible content / HTML entry of any kind?

#### Do we have room for additional reusable atoms to be produced? (there are 4 total by my count)

#### What should we call each of them?
